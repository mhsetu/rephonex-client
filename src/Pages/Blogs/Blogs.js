          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
        </p>
        <p>
          In a React application, state management can be approached in several
          ways depending on the complexity and requirements of the project. The
          most common methods include using stateful components (class
          components), functional components with hooks like useState for local
          state management, and leveraging the Context API for sharing state
          across components without prop drilling. Additionally, state
          management libraries such as Redux offer centralized global state
          management, making it easier to manage complex application states and
          interactions across different components. Another strategy involves
          lifting state up to common ancestors or using third-party libraries
          like MobX for more specialized needs. Each approach offers distinct
          benefits in terms of simplicity, scalability, and reactivity, catering
          to different architectural needs and development preferences within
          React applications.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </p>
        <p>
          Prototypical inheritance in JavaScript works by allowing objects to
          inherit properties and methods from other objects directly. Every
          object in JavaScript has a prototype object, which acts as a blueprint
          for that object. When you access a property or method on an object,
          JavaScript first checks if the object itself has that property or
          method. If it doesn't find it, it looks up the prototype chain, moving
          up to the prototype of the current object, and continues this process
          until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the
          chain (where the base object Object.prototype resides). This chain of
          prototypes allows for efficient property/method sharing across objects
          and forms the basis of JavaScript's object-oriented programming model,
          where inheritance is achieved by linking objects through their
          prototypes rather than through classes.

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
        </p>
        <p>
          A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units or
          components of a software application are tested in isolation from the
          rest of the application. It verifies that each unit of code (typically
          a function or method) performs as expected, based on its design and
          specification. Unit tests are usually automated and run during the
          development phase to catch bugs early and ensure that each unit
          behaves correctly under various conditions. They help maintain code
          quality by providing rapid feedback to developers, aiding in
          refactoring and preventing regressions when new features are added or
          changes are made. Overall, writing unit tests promotes better software
          design, reduces the likelihood of defects in production, and
          contributes to more maintainable and reliable codebases.

          React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
        </p>
        <p>
          React, Angular, and Vue are all popular JavaScript
          frameworks/libraries used for building modern web applications, each
          with its own approach and philosophy. React, developed and maintained
          by Facebook, is a lightweight library focused on building user
          interfaces with a component-based architecture. It emphasizes
          flexibility, performance, and a declarative approach to building UIs.
          Angular, developed and maintained by Google, is a comprehensive
          framework offering a full suite of tools for building large-scale
          applications. It provides strong opinions on architecture, features
          like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a robust CLI for
          development. Vue, created by Evan You, strikes a balance between React
          and Angular, offering a progressive framework that can be
          incrementally adopted. It excels in simplicity, flexibility, and ease
          of integration into existing projects, with a straightforward API and
          reactive data binding. Choosing between them often depends on project
          requirements, team expertise, and development preferences regarding
          flexibility, scalability, and ecosystem support.
